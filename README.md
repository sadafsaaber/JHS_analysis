# JHS_analysis
This is my SAS code that I used for the completion of a project for my BIOS 591 class. For this project, I determined how
different variables might affect systolic blood pressure. To do this, I had built an associative model that best accounts for the variability
of my outcome variable (systolic blood pressure). I used the Jackson Heart study, which was an observational epidemiologic investigation of
cardiovascular disease in 5300 African American individuals living in Jackson, MS.
